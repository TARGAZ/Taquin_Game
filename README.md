# Taquin_Game
This project his about making a Taquin game in C in 1 weak for a school project

## How to play
### Windows
I recommend to use VisualStudio to launch the game. In the arg you need the number of squares you want in your picture, the name of the picture it needs to be a .bmp file and the size of the picture. By default, you can use 3 3 chat.bmp 100 200.

### Linux
I recommend to use gcc has a compiler. In the arg you need the number of squares you want in your picture, the name of the picture it needs to be a .bmp file and the size of the picture. By default, you can use 3 3 chat.bmp 100 200.

### Key
UP -> Move the empty square up.
DOWNS -> Move the empty square downs.
RIGHT -> Move the empty square right.
LEFT -> Move the empty square left.
F1 -> Solve the taquin with A*. Solving a taquin doesn't work every time if you have a game larger than 3x3 because of a looping issue.
